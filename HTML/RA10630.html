            <p id="p4div3">
                <strong>Protection of children: </strong>RA 10630 aims to protect the rights and welfare of children 
                in conflict with the law. It recognizes that children are vulnerable and need special 
                care and attention, focusing on their rehabilitation and reintegration into society 
                rather than punishment.
            </p>
            <p id="p5div3">
                <strong>Age-appropriate interventions: </strong>The law establishes a comprehensive juvenile 
                justice system that promotes age-appropriate interventions for children in conflict 
                with the law. It recognizes that children have different levels of maturity and 
                understanding compared to adults, and therefore require specialized approaches in 
                dealing with their offences.  
            </p>

            <p id="p6div3">
                <strong>Restorative justice:</strong> RA 10630 promotes the principles of restorative justice, which 
                focuses on repairing the harm caused by the offense and addressing the needs of 
                both the victim and the offender. It encourages the involvement of the community in 
                the rehabilitation process and emphasizes the importance of accountability and 
                responsibility.
            </p>
            <p id="p7div3">
                <strong>Rehabilitation and reintegration:</strong> The law prioritizes the rehabilitation and 
                reintegration of children in conflict with the law into their families and 
                communities. It provides for the establishment of youth rehabilitation centers and 
                programs that aim to address the underlying factors that contribute to their 
                involvement in offenses.
            </p>
            <p id="p8div3">
                <strong>International compliance:</strong> RA 10630 aligns with international standards 
                and obligations, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
                the Child (UNCRC). It ensures that the Philippines fulfills its commitment to 
                protect the rights and welfare of children in conflict with the law, in line with 
                international norms.
